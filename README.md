# ENS Offchain Resolver Gateway

> [!NOTE]  
> See [gskril/ens-offchain-registrar](https://github.com/gskril/ens-offchain-registrar) for a more modern, fully featured example.

This repo implements a simple CCIP-Read endpoint for offchain ENS resolution that fetches name data from an external API.

Examples for serving the endpoint as a standalone [Node service](node/README.md) or a [Next.js API route](nextjs/README.md) are provided.
